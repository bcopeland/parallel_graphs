This project contains experimentation on graph parallelism, using the parallel
boost graphics library on MPI.  This evaluates performance of graph algorithms
for different partitionings of the input set.

Build prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This was tested using boost 1.40.0 as installed by my distribution.
In order to build it with a local copy of boost, do the following:

1. Download boost from:
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.40.0/

2. Then do the following steps (substitute boost path in the appropriate
location):
    $ echo "using mpi ; " > ~/user-config.jam
    $ mkdir boost_inst
    $ tar xjvf boost-1.4.0.tar.bz2
    $ cd boost_1_40_0
    $ ./bootstrap.sh \
        --prefix=/path/to/boost_inst \
        --with-libraries=mpi,system,graph,graph_parallel,filesystem,date_time
    $ ./bjam
    $ ./bjam install

3. Edit Makefile and set BOOST_ROOT then run "$ make"

This much was tested on cluster420 and Amazon EC2, though there may be some
required fiddling with the link libraries if there is another copy of
boost on the machine.

The Kernighan-Lin partitioner uses glib-2.0 for its hash table.  If not
needed, it can be commented out of the build.

queue_modified.ipp is a modified version of the distributed queue to
put in the boost install directory.  This records some additional
information used when making charts.

The script speedup.sh runs bfs for various partitions and records the
output.  It can be parsed by make_charts.pl but this requires the
aforementioned queue changes.

I did not include the twitter graph, because it is too big to email.
I can provide it on request.  Instead there is wikipedia.graph
and wikipedia.part which give the file format (this is the graph
on the wikipedia page for PageRank used to test the pagerank executable).

There are various executables here -- delta stepping shortest paths,
pagerank, and bfs.  I experimented with the others but only
reported results for bfs since the paper was already long enough.

The version of METIS I used was serial metis-4.0.  Parallel versions
would be good too but they don't include the command line utilities.
The undirect.pl script converts a directed graph to an undirected
version.
